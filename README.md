# Cryptocurrency Graph Tracer (2017)

A black screen version of cryptocurrency graph used for tracing prices. It also has an alarm at which you can set the price for going off.
Powered by [Bitfinex](www.bitfinex.com) and [30rates](30rates.com).

## Installation

1. Download the source.
2. Compile the `cpp` files (with linkers from `linker.txt`).
3. Copy your alarm ringtone to the folder where `launcher.exe` is put and rename it to `default.mp3`.

## How to use

You just need to read and follow the instructions from the program carefully. Believe me, it's very easy to use.

## Changelog

Initial release (on Github).
The project was abandoned.

## Cons

- Shortcut has bugs. If you run multiple programs at once, shortcut is triggered on every program.
- Graph rendering is not optimized.
- The project is **not** up to date so everything won't work as expected on the long run.
- qEngine is not available.
